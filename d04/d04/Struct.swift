I am studying in "School 21" of Sberbank(the branch of 42 School) and try to create some useful apps for my environment. Also, I am learning Swift now, and such experience will help me in future. Thanks!
I will create a struct Tweet with name of user and descriprion of his tweet. Then I will put data in TableViewController and then display it on iPhone`s screen.
Not at this moment. I just want to display all data of my struct on iPhone. Maybe, in future I will realise other futures.
